# Rock_Paper_Scissors Game 




I implemented a Rock–Paper–Scissors game as a single-page application using React. One of the main goals was to create an interactive interface where the user can select a throw, the computer animates through random choices, and the final result is displayed.A challenge I encountered was correctly handling CSS imports and ensuring each component updated without causing a page reload.
